What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","- Python is a programming language widely used for various purpose like data analysis, machine learning, web development etc.It is populat because it is widely used in industry due to its ease of readability and learning making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced."],"metadata":{"id":"fEE2OcWwEvcq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.

What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","\n","- Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes, such as if, while, and else.

What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","- The == operator checks for value equality, meaning it compares whether the values of two objects are the same.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","- Implicit type casting is automatically done by Python when it converts one data type to another, usually to avoid data loss example: converting an integer to a float when necessary.\n","\n","- Explicit type casting requires the programmer to manually convert one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OfUQG8NSO_YG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.
