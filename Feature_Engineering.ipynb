        "\n",
        " A parameter is a variable used by a model that is learned during the training phase (e.g., weights in linear regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        " Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, indicating whether they move together or inversely.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        " Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases (e.g., rainfall and outdoor activities).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        " Machine Learning enables systems to learn from data to make predictions; its main components include data, features, models, training, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "\n",
        " Loss value quantifies the error between predicted and actual values; lower loss indicates a better model.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        " Continuous variables have numerical values (e.g., height); categorical variables represent categories (e.g., colors).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
        "\n",
        " Categorical variables are handled using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        " Training is used to fit the model, while testing evaluates its performance on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is sklearn.preprocessing??\n",
        "\n",
        " sklearn.preprocessing is a module in Scikit-learn for transforming data, such as scaling and encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is a Test set?\n",
        "\n",
        " A test set is a subset of data reserved for evaluating the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Use train_test_split from Scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
        "\n",
        " Steps include defining the problem, collecting data, performing EDA, feature engineering, selecting a model, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
        "\n",
        " EDA helps understand data patterns, detect outliers, and identify relationships for better model building.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. what is correlation?\n",
        "\n",
        " Correlation is a statistical measure that describes how two variables are related.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "\n",
        " It indicates an inverse relationship where one variable decreases as the other increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Use df.corr() for correlation matrices or scipy.stats.pearsonr for specific variable pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        " Causation implies one variable affects another (e.g., smoking causes lung issues); correlation (e.g., ice cream sales and drowning) does not imply causation.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "  An optimizer adjusts model weights to minimize loss; examples include Gradient Descent, Adam, and RMSprop.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is sklearn.linear_model?\n",
        "\n",
        " It’s a Scikit-learn module for linear modeling, such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "\n",
        "  It trains the model using the input data (e.g., model.fit(X_train, y_train)).\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
        "\n",
        " It predicts outcomes using the trained model (e.g., model.predict(X_test)).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Continuous variables are numerical; categorical variables are non-numeric and represent groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        " Feature scaling standardizes data ranges for consistent model performance, especially with distance-based algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Use Scikit-learn’s StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler for normalization or standardization.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Explain data encoding?\n",
        "\n",
        " Data encoding transforms categorical variables into numerical formats for model compatibility (e.g., one-hot encoding)."
